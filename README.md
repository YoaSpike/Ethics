For testing/evaluation, all you need installed is the JDK.

Once installed, run, `activator run`, with the appropriate executable calling syntax for whichever system you're using, and the `activator` executable will download and install all required dependencies.

Once running, the server will inform you of the web address you can use the access it. If you have any issues please feel free to contact me via me@mause.me
